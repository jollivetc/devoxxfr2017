Slide from Devoxx France 2017 conférence : "une application qui voit, entend et répond"

The presentation was done with Mickael Debonnaire https://github.com/mdebonnaire

## Beware

If you are using Chrome, on the third slide, "speakers", if you are using Chrome, it will ask to use your microphone. There is a API.ai bot used to do the presentation.
You just have to ask "Jarvis, peux-tu présenter Mickael ?" or "Peux-tu présenter Christophe ?".
Your browser will stop listening on the next slide.
You can see it is listening as there is a red dot insted of the closing cross at the top of tab.

Be careful, the bot will register everything that is said.
